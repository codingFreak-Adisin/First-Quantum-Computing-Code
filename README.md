# First-Quantum-Computing-Code
This is my first time coding into a Qauntum Computer using Cirq which is an open-source framework for Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum Computers.

Really happy to see this

Now I will be focusing on Quantum Computers as I find them really interesting and one of the growing industries.

Next will try to code in Qiskit which is a open source quantum chip from IBM
